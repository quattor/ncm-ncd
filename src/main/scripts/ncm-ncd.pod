=head1 NAME

ncm-ncd - Node Configuration Dispatcher
      of the NCM (Node Configuration Management) subsystem

      quattor toolsuite http://cern.ch/quattor

=head1 SYNOPSIS

ncm-ncd --configure   [options] [<component1> [<component2>] ...]
ncm-ncd --unconfigure [options] component

(See ncm-ncd --help for full list of options with default values.)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<ncm-ncd> is the front end for invoking NCM configuration
components. The B<ncm-ncd> is called with a list of components to be
invoked as an argument. Based on this list, the B<ncd> looks up the
inter-component dependencies, orders the components, and invokes each
component sequentially.

If no component is specified, the B<ncd> will invoke all
components which are marked as active in the node configuration
profile. These are considered to be the 'default' components to run.

The B<ncd> can be executed manually, via B<cron>, or via the
B<cdispd>.

If a dependency is not fulfilled, the B<ncd> exits with an
appropriate error message and return status.

In case of deinstallation of a component using B<--unconfigure>,
the B<ncd> is to be called with the component's name as a
parameter.


=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item --configure

run the 'configure' method for <component1,2..> (default option). For running configure on all components, use --configure --all.

=item --all

See above. Run --configure --all to run configure on all components.

=item --skip <component>

skip one component (only to be used with --all)

=item --unconfigure

run the 'unconfigure' method for <component>. Only one component can
be unconfigured at a time.

=item --logdir <dir>

directory where to place ncm-ncd and component log files

=item --retries <n>

try 'n' times if locked (another ncm-ncd instance is running).

=item --state <dir>

directory in which to find state files. On conclusion of any component
configuration, if the configuration was successful then the component
file will be deleted from this state directory. If a component
produces errors, then the component file will contain the number of errors.
In other words, if a configuration is clean then there will be
no files within the state directory. If there are any problems with
the configuration, then there will be a file for the failing
components. An empty file indicates that the component has not
completed its configuration. If this option is not defined, then
no state files will be maintained.

=item --timeout <n>

wait a maximum of 'n' seconds between retries.

=item --ignorelock

Ignore existing application lock. Use with care.

=item --forcelock

Take over application lock. Use with care.

=item --useprofile <profile_id>

use <profile_id> as NVA-API configuration profile ID (default: latest)

=item --cache_root <directory>

CCM cache root directory (optional, otherwise CCM default taken)

=item --multilog

use separate (per component) log files in log directory

=item --nodeps

ignore broken (pre/post) dependencies when invoking configure

=item --autodeps

expand missing pre/post dependencies in configure

=item --allowbrokencomps

Do not stop overall execution if 'broken' components are found, just ignore
these ('broken' components: component file missing or not instantiable)

=item --list

Does nothing but list all found components, in the following format:

name - active? - installed?

=item --pre-hook, --post-hook

Hooks to be executed before any component is run or after all
components have been executed.

The C<post-hook> will receive a JSON object via stdin with the
components that succeeded, failed or had warnings.

=item --pre-hook-timeout, --post-hook-timeout

Timeouts, in seconds, for the C<--pre-hook> and C<--post-hook>

A value of 0 means no time out.  By default they time out after 5 minutes.

=back

=head2 Other Options

=over

=item --help

Displays a help message with all options and default settings.

=item --version

Displays application version information.

=item --verbose

Print verbose details on operations.

=item --debug <1..5>

Set the debugging level to <1..5>.

=item --facility <f>

Set the syslog facility to <f> (Eg. local1).

=item --quiet

Suppress application output to standard output.

=item --noaction

Do not actually perform operations.

=item --include <directories>

A colon-seperated list of directories to include in search path for ncm-components

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

A configuration file can keep site-wide configuration settings. The
location of the configuration file is defined in the --cfgfile
option. A default configuration file is found in
/etc/ncm-ncd.conf

=head1 SIGNAL HANDLING

If a signal is received, the ncm-ncd will try to finish its execution
gracefully and will report an error (return status: -1), except if
it was called with the --noaction flag.
